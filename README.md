# symmetry78
A rearranged handwired 75% keyboard powered by QMK Firmware.

Function row, navigation cluster and arrow keys found on a typical 75% keyboard arrangement have been moved as macro columns to the left and right of the alphas and modifiers for better symmetry.

Current layers contain:
(0) - Standard QWERTY Layout (Caps Lock has been remapped to Ctrl)
(1) - Typical 60% Function row location on the alpha numbers, Volume controls on R/L arrows, PgUp/Pgdn on Home/End, Caps Lock restored, plus a tap-toggle layer on F2 to the DVORAK layout
(2) - DVORAK Layout (Caps Lock has been remapped to Ctrl)
(3) - Same as (1), plus a toggle layer on F2 to the default layer (0)

Current pinouts are making use of an Elite-C.
